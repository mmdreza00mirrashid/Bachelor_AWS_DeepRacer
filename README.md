## What is AWS Deepracer?
<div align="center">
    <p align="justify"> 
      DeepRacer is a platform that allows developers to learn about and experiment with reinforcement learning (RL) through an autonomous race car. The car is a 1/18th scale model that is controlled by a computer and can be programmed to navigate a physical track using machine learning algorithms. AWS DeepRacer is designed to be easy to use for developers of all skill levels, with a focus on making it easy to learn about and experiment with RL.
